\begin{abstract}
    This article reports a characterization of interaction networks and its temporal stability. Such a task involves a selection of aspects to investigate, which lead to: 1) activity distribution in time and among participants; 2) a sound classification of vertex: peripheral, intermediary and hub sectors; 3) combination of basic measures into components with greater dispersion (PCA). While time patterns of activity are not obvious, participant activity follows concentrations expected in scale-free networks. Comparison of incident networks with ideal Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks bearing the same number of edges and vertexes reveals a sound criterion for distinguishing sectors on the networks. Principal components in the basic measures space revealed interesting and regular patterns of independence and dispersion. This includes a ranking of measures that most contribute to dispersion: 1) degree and strength measures, 2) symmetry related quantization, and 3) clusterization. Results suggest typologies for these networks and participants. Further work include considerations of text production, psychoanalysis inspired typologies, participatory democracy exploitation of observed properties, and better visualization support for network evolution.

\section{\label{sec:into}Introduction}
The present work is aimed at finding common characteristics among (email) interaction networks. This includes observations along time, which imply network evolution, a field that has received dedicated attention from the research community
for more than a decade~\cite{barabasiEvo,newmanEvolving}.

While significant measures will depend on the model and system characteristics~\cite{newmanStru, newmanWeight},
this work considers only directed, weighted and human interaction networks. Undirected and unweighted representation of such networks is also found in the literature and can be obtained by simplification~\cite{GMANE2}.

Text mining and typologies of online participants benefit from the results here presented~\cite{rcText,rcTipo}. 
Although all networks considered originated from email lists,
 coherence with literature suggests that results hold for a more general class of interaction networks,
 such as observed in online platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter).


\subsection{Related work}
This work approaches network stability through temporal evolution observations.
This evolution is characterized by a constant number of contiguous messages, of which snapshots are considered to yield a timeline of the network, which is not explored to date, as far as authors know~\cite{netWindowEvo}.
 Works on network evolution often consider solely network growth, in which there is a monotonic increase in the number of events considered~\cite{barabasiEvo}. Moreover, selected exceptions are reported in this section.

 The evolution of interaction networks was addressed with a community focus, in a work that ignores the direction of edges~\cite{barabasiEvo}. Two topologically different networks are reported to emerge, depending on the frequency of interactions, presenting a generalized power law or an exponential connectivity distribution~\cite{barabasiTopologicalEv}. 
In email networks, free-scale properties were verified~\cite{bird}, and different linguistic traces were related to weak and strong ties~\cite{GMANE2}.

 Such results are in accordance with phenomena observed in this work. Linguistic characterization is being described in a deriving article~\cite{rcText}. See Appendix~\ref{sec:fure} for further considerations of related work, with emphasis on the results from research herein reported.

\section{Data description}
    \subsection{Email lists and messages}
Email list messages were obtained from
the GMANE email archive~\cite{GMANE}, which consists of more than 20,000 email lists and more than 130,000,000 messages~\cite{GMANEwikipedia}. These lists cover a variety of topics, mostly technology-related. It can be described as a corpus with metadata of its messages, such as time, place, sender name, sender email address.
GMANE usage in scientific research is reported in studies of isolated lists and of lexical innovations~\cite{GMANE2,bird}. Appendix~\ref{scripts} is dedicated scripts for gathering and processing GMANE email messages.

    \subsection{Chosen dataset}
The four lists below were selected for the resulting diversity, easing initial observance of natural and general properties.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux Audio Users list\footnote{gmane.linux.audio.users is list ID in GMANE.}. Dominated by participants with hybrid artistic and technological interests. Participants are from different countries, and English is the language used the most. Abbreviated as LAU from now on.
    \item Linux Audio Developers list\footnote{gmane.linux.audio.devel is list ID in GMANE.}. Participants are from different countries, and English is the language used the most. A more technical and less active version of LAU. Abbreviated LAD from now on.
    \item Development list for the standard C++ library\footnote{gmane.comp.gcc.libstdc++.devel is list ID in GMANE.}. Dominated by specialized computer programmers. Participants are from different countries, and English is the language used the most. Abbreviated as CPP from now on.
    \item List of the MetaReciclagem project\footnote{gmane.politics.organizations.metareciclagem is list ID in GMANE.}. Dominated by Brazilian activists and digital culture interests. Participants are mostly Brazilians, and Portuguese is the most used language, although Spanish and English are also incident. Abbreviated MET from now on.
\end{itemize} 

 The first 20,000 messages of each list were considered, with total timespan, authors, threads and missing messages exposed in Table~\ref{geralListas}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Columns $date_1$ and $date_M$ have first and last message dates from the 20,000 messages considered in each email list.
$N$ is the number of participants (number of different email addresses).
$\Gamma$ is the number of threads (count of messages without antecedent).
$\overline{M}$ is messages missing in the 20,000 collection, $100\frac{23}{20000}=0.115$ percent in the worst case.
MET notably has the fewer participants and the larger number of threads.
This relation holds for each pair of the lists considered: as the number of participants increases,
 the number of threads decreases.}
  \label{geralListas}

\end{table}



\section{Characterization methods}
After immersion with the data and appropriated literature, the following methods for network characterization were chosen: 1) statistics of activity along time; 2) division of network in hubs, intermediary and peripheral vertex; 3) prominence of topological measures; 4) evolutive visualizations and quantitative observations; 5) typological elaborations of networks and participants.
Each of these methods are described bellow with supporting structures.

    \subsection{Temporal activity statistics}
Number of messages along time with respect to seconds, minutes, hours, days of the week, days of the month, and months of the year. These are exhibited as tables in Appendix~\ref{tabTime}. Results are outlined in Section~\ref{constDisc}.

    \subsection{Interaction network}\label{intNet}
Regarding literature~\cite{bird,newmanCommunityDirected,newmanCommunity2013}, interaction networks can be modeled both weighted or unweighted, both directed or undirected. Networks in this article are directed and weighted, considered as more informative among possibilities (directed unweighted, undirected weighted, and undirected unweighted).
More precisely, the networks reported are erected as follows: a direct response from participant B to a message from participant A yields an edge from A to B, as information went from A to B. The reasoning is: if B wrote a response to a message from A, he read what A wrote and formulated a response, so B assimilated information from A, thus $A \rightarrow B$. Inverting edge direction yields the status network, as B read the message and considered what A wrote worth responding, giving status to A, thus $B\rightarrow A$. This article uses the information network described above and depicted in Figure~\ref{formationNetwork}. Edges in both directions are allowed. Each time an interaction occurs, one is added to edge weight. Self-loops were regarded as non-informative and discarded. This networks are described as exhibiting free-scale and small world properties, as expected for a social network~\cite{bird}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/criaRede_}
    \caption{Formation of interaction network from email messages. Each vertex represents a participant. A reply message from participant B to a message from participant A is considered as evidence that B received information from A. Multiple messages add ``weight'' to directed edge. Further details are in Section~\ref{intNet}.}
    \label{formationNetwork}
\end{figure}


Previous messages on the thread create directed edges from their author to the observed message's author. Edges can be created from all antecedent messages on the message-response thread. In this work, only the immediate predecessor are linked to new message's author, both for simplicity and for the valid objection that in adding two edges, $x\rightarrow y$ and $y\rightarrow z$, there is also a connection between $x\rightarrow z$. Potential interpretations for this weaker connection are usually common sense, such as: double length, half weight or with one more ``obstacle''. This suggests the adoption of other centrality measures that account for the connectivity with all nodes, such as betweenness centrality and accessibility~\cite{luMeasures,access}.


        \subsubsection{Sectioning network in periphery, intermediary and hubs classes}\label{sectioning}

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/fser}
    \caption{Degree distribution on scale-free and Erd\"os-R\'enyi ideal networks. The later has more
        intermediary, as the former has more peripheral and hub vertexes. Sections are
        given by the two intersections $k_1$ and $k_2$ of the connectivity distributions. Characteristic degrees
    are in compact intervals of degree: $[0,k_1]$, $(k_1,k_2]$, $(k_2,k_{max}]$ for the three sections considered (periphery, intermediary and hubs).}
    \label{fig:setores}
\end{figure}

Because of social networks tendency to have a scale-free distribution of connectivity,
one can compare it to an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph and consider peripheral, intermediary and hub
sectors~\cite{3setores}, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:setores}.
The degree distribution $\widetilde{P}(k)$ of an ideal
scale-free network $\mathcal{N}_f$ with $N$ vertexes and $z$ edges, has less
average degree nodes when compared with the distribution $P(k)$ of an Erd\"os-R\'enyi
random graph with the same number of vertexes and edges:

\begin{equation}\label{criterio}
    \widetilde{P}(k)<P(k) \Rightarrow \text{k is intermediary degree}
\end{equation}

If $\mathcal{N}_f$ is directed and has no self-loops, the probability
of the presence of an edge between two arbitrary vertexes is $p_e=\frac{z}{N(N-1)}$ (see Appendix~\ref{ap:ded}).
A vertex in the ideal Erd\"os-R\'enyi digraph with the same number of vertexes and edges, and thus the same probability $p_e$ for the presence of an edge, will have degree $k$ with probability:

\begin{equation}
    P(k)=\binom{2(N-1)}{k}p^k(1-p)^{2(N-1)-k}
\end{equation}

The lower degree fat tail constitute the border
vertexes or peripheral sector. 
The higher degree fat tail is the hub sector.

The arguments behind this classification are: 1) vertexes so connected that they are virtually inexistent in networks whose edges are incident regardless of vertex properties, are correctly associated to the hubs sector. Vertexes with very few connections, which are way more abundant than expected in networks whose edges are incident regardless of vertex properties, are correctly associated to periphery. Degree values near average, predicted as the most abundant if connections are created without criteria, and less frequent in free-scale phenomena, are correctly associated to intermediary vertexes.

To assure statistical validity, bins can be chosen to contain at least $\eta$ vertexes. Thus, each bin, starting at degree $k_i$, spans $\Delta_i=[k_{i},k_{j}]$ degree values, where $j$ is the smallest integer in which degrees $k_i$-$k_{j}$ contain at least $\eta$ values. This changes equation~\ref{criterio} to:

\begin{equation}\label{criterio2}
    \sum_{x=k_i}^{k_j} \widetilde{P}(x) < \sum_{x=k_i}^{k_j} P(x) \Rightarrow \text{i is intermediary}
\end{equation}

If instead strength $s$ is used for comparison, $P$ remains the same, but $P(\kappa_i)$ with $\kappa_i=\frac{s_i}{\overline{w}}$ should be used for comparison, with $\overline{w}$ the average weight of an edge and $s_i$ the vertex strength. For in and out degrees and strengths, comparisons should be made with $\kappa_i=2k_i^{in}$, $\kappa_i=2k_i^{out}$, $\kappa_i=2\frac{s_i^{in}}{\overline{w}}$ and $\kappa_i=2\frac{s_i^{out}}{\overline{w}}$. Results of these criteria for network segmentation are discussed in subsection~\ref{subsec:pih}.


As a further refinement of the network segmentation, compound criteria is used for classification of vertex, considering all measures: total, in and out degree and strength. After a careful inspection of possible combinations, these were abbreviated to six:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exclusivist criteria: vertex are only classified if the class is the same with respect to all measures. In this case, total vertex classified (usually) does not reach 100\%, which is depicted by a black line in Appendix~\ref{figures}.
    \item Inclusivist criteria: vertex has class given by any of the measures. In this case, a vertex can have more than one class and the fraction of class attribution beyond total number of vertexes is also depicted by a black line in Appendix~\ref{figures}.
    \item Exclusivist cascade: hubs are only hubs if classified as hub with respect to all measures. Intermediary are the vertexes classified as intermediary or hub with respect to all measures. Vertexes left are regarded as peripheral vertex.
    \item Inclusivist cascade: hubs are vertexes classified as hubs by any of the measures. From the vertexes left, if any is classified as intermediary by any measure, than it is intermediary. The rest of the vertexes are peripheral.
    \item Exclusivist externals: hubs have unanimous classification with respect to all measures. Of vertexes left, peripheral vertexes are the ones classified as hub or peripheral by simple criterion. The rest represent intermediary sector.
    \item Inclusivist externals: hubs are vertexes classified as hubs with respect to any measure. From vertexes left, if a vertex is classified as peripheral with respect to any measure, than it is peripheral. The rest is regarded intermediary sector.
\end{itemize}

These compound criteria, and reduction of possibilities to them, can be formalized in strict mathematical terms. This was considered out of the scope of the present article. 

Results from applying this classification method is further reported in Section~\ref{subsec:pih}.

        \subsubsection{Topological measures}\label{measures}
This article
restricts topological analysis to a small selection of the most basic
measures of each vertex:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Degree $d_i$: number edges linked to node $i$.
    \item In-degree $d_i^{in}$: number of edges ending at node $i$.
    \item Out-degree $d_i^{out}$: number of edges departing from node $i$.
    \item Strength $s$: sum of weights of all edges linked to node $i$.
    \item In-strength $s_i^{in}$: sum of weights of all edges ending at node $i$.
    \item Out-strength $s_i^{out}$: sum of weights of all edges departing from node $i$.
    \item Clustering coefficient $cc_i$: fraction of pairs of neighbors of $i$ that are linked. This is the standard clustering coefficient for undirected graphs. Usage of other clustering coefficients (e.g. for directed graphs) was considering out of scope, as such clustering coefficients are usually employed in special contexts. 
    \item Betweenness centrality $bt_i$: fraction of geodesics that contain the node $i$. Betweenness centrality index considered directions and weight, as specified in~\cite{faster}.
\end{itemize}

In order to capture asymmetries in the activity of participants, the following metrics were introduced (see subsection~\ref{prevalence}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item asymmetry of vertex $i$: $asy_i=\frac{d_i^{in}-d_i^{out}}{d_i}$.
    \item mean of edge asymmetry of vertex $i$: $\mu_i^{asy}=\frac{\sum_{j\in J_i} e_{ji}-e_{ij}}{|J_i|}$. Where $e_{xy}$ is 1 if there is and edge from $x$ to $y$, $0$ otherwise. $|J_i|$ is the number of neighbors of vertex $i$.
    \item standard deviation of edge asymmetry of vertex $i$: $\sigma_i^{asy}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{j\in J_i}[\mu_{asy} -(e_{ji}-e_{ij}) ]^2  }{|J_i|}  }$
    \item disequilibrium of vertex $i$: $dis_i=\frac{s_i^{in}-s_i^{out}}{s_i}$.
    \item mean of edge disequilibrium of vertex $i$: $\mu_i^{dis}=\frac{\sum_{j \in J_i}\frac{w_{ji}-w_{ij}}{s_i}}{|J_i|}$, where $w_{xy}$ is weight of edge $x\rightarrow y$ and zero if there is no such edge.
    \item standard deviation of edge disequilibrium of vertex $i$: $\sigma_i^{dis}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{j\in J_i}[\mu_{dis}-\frac{(w_{ji}-w_{ij})}{s_i}]^2}{|J_i|}}$
\end{itemize}


   \subsection{Evolutive observations}
Evolution of network is observed within a fixed number of messages (window size: $ws$) that shifts in the message timeline.
 All $ws=$ 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, 2500, 5000 and 10000 were used. Within a same $ws$, the number vertexes and edges vary in time, as do other network characteristics. Further work should deepen inspection of measure interdependence, this article holds to measures in Section~\ref{measures}.

        \subsubsection*{Visualization of network evolution}
In refining hypotheses, visualization of the network was crucial. Animations, image galleries and online gadgets were made~\cite{animacoes,galGMANE,appGMANE}. Mapping of various topological measures to glyphs and layouts are being further explored as a parallel research. Furthermore, stable aspects of measures prominence along time are captured through mean and standard deviation (see Section~\ref{measures} and Appendix~\ref{sec:pcat}). Constant sector sizes along time are observed in a timeline fashion in Appendix~\ref{figures}.


    \subsection{Typological deepening}
There are other ways to split a network. To point a common example, the center of the network is defined as all the nodes whose maximum distance to any other node is the radius\footnote{Radius is the minimum maximum distance to all nodes. Equivalently, the radius is the minimum eccentricity.}. 
In the same framework, the periphery (as opposed to the center) consists of the nodes whose maximum distance to any node is the diameter\footnote{Diameter is the maximum geodesic on the network.}. Accordingly, the intermediary sector can be defined as the nodes that are not in the center or in the periphery. Interestingly, in the email networks analyzed, with these criteria, the center can often be a factor of 4 times larger than the periphery and the intermediary group often exceed 93\% of the nodes~\cite{networkx}.

Models of human dynamics can be used to predict and classify activity. In this case, agent activity is commonly considered a Poisson process, as a consequence of the randomly distributed events in time. Even so, evidence-based models suggests that human activity patterns follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by a long tail of inactivity with of bursts of rapidly occurring events~\cite{barabasiHumanDyn,barabasiPhone}. Emails are reported as having a heavy tailed distribution with $\alpha=1$, together with web browsing and library loans~\cite{barabasiHumanDyn}.

Typologies can also be conveniently adapted from psychiatric, psychological and psychoanalytic theories. 
Concerning empirical research,
Theodor Adorno was a core conceiver of an one-of-a-kind typology that resulted from observing authoritarian
personality traces\footnote{Some of them related to Nazism adoption, antisemitism and potential fascists.}, sometimes depicted as an authoritarian syndrome.
%Influenced by Social and Psychoanalytic Theories, Adorno et all applied a questionnaire to individuals, from which they reached a position in the the ``F Scale'', to verify etnocentric, conservatory and antidemocratic trends~\cite{adorno}. From psychoanalitic interviews and the F Scale, they derived a typology, which gathers prejudice-inclined traces in personality. Both, low and high scores are considered with prejudicial traces. This typology has nine authoritarian types, the six types with high score in the F Scale: surface resentment, conventional, authoritarian, rebel and psychopath, crank, manipulative; and three of the five types with low score in the F Scale: rigid, protesting, impulsive, easygoing, genuine liberal. Each side of the dipole has a rank of intensity that increases as the order written above.
 Other typologies include Jung's extroversion-introversion trait with four modes of orientation. This four modes are divided in two perceiving functions (sensation and intuition) and two judging functions (thinking and feeling)~\cite{jung}. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator extrapolated Jungian theories into a questionnaire and added perceiving and judging as a fourth dipole~\cite{myers}. Even plain Freudian criteria, such as neurosis, psychosis, perversity and denegation, can be used directly for such categorization, as they have verbal and behavioral typical traces~\cite{freud,freud2}.

It was considered central to benefit from key human typologies, both by adding descriptions to a type and by further characterizing classes in the terms encountered.

\section{Results and discussion}
    \subsection{Constancy and discrepancy of activity along time}\label{constDisc}
        \subsubsection{Seconds and minutes}
The incidence of messages at each second in a minute and at each minute in an hour is compatible with uniform distribution tests.
If compared to simulations using an uniform distribution\footnote{Numpy version 1.6.1, ``random.randint'' function.}, messages were slightly more evenly distributed in all lists: for both seconds and minutes  $\frac{max(incidence)}{min(incidence)} \in (1.26,1.275]$. Simulations reach these values, but have in average more discrepant higher and lower peaks $\xi=\frac{max(incidence')}{min(incidence')} \Rightarrow \mu_\xi=1.2918 \text{ and } \sigma_\xi=0.04619$.

        \subsubsection{Hours of the day}
Table~\ref{dia} shows how the four lists distribute activity along the day.
Afternoon was the most active 6h period of the day. Second 12h more active than first 12h. Even so, activity peak occurs around midday, with a skew towards earlier hours.


        \subsubsection{Days of the week}
 Weekdays also exhibit an interesting pattern, to which is dedicated Table~\ref{semana}: a decrease of activity on weekends of at least one third, reaching two thirds in extreme cases.
        \subsubsection{Days along the month}
 Table~\ref{mes} shows activity along the month, in which no prevalent pattern was observed.
 Variation of activity in the days along the month is less prominent, one cannot point much more than a - probably not statistically relevant - tendency of first and second weeks to be more active. The most important trait might be their homogeneity with respect to activity. Last days of the month (29, 30 and 31) are not present in every month, and observed activity is proportional to incidence rates.



        \subsubsection{Months and larger divisions of the year}
Table~\ref{ano} is dedicated to activity in months and larger divisions of the year.
Observation points two periods of more prominent activities: Jun-Aug (MET and LAD), and Dec-Mar (CPP, LAU and LAD), which fit academic calendars, vacations and end-of-year holidays.

    \subsection{Scalable fat-tail structure}\label{subsec:pih}

There is a concentration of hub activity and of vertex with few connections. Table~\ref{autores} is dedicated to exposing this distribution of activity among participants.

As specified in Section~\ref{sectioning}, in order to classify nodes as hubs, intermediary or peripheral, the incident connectivity distribution $\widetilde{P}(k)$ is compared
to a connectivity distribution of an ideal Erd\"os R\`enyi network $P(k)$ with the same number of vertexes and edges. In the networks inspected for this article (see Section~\ref{intNet}), if degree distribution is used for classification, hubs sector size reaches peaks with $10\%$ of all vertexes. 
 If strength is used for comparison ($\widetilde{P}(k_i=\frac{s_i}{\overline{w}})$) is compared
to $P(k_i)$), hubs account for approximately $5\%$ of all vertex, i.e. strength classification yields half the number of hubs as plain degree. 
This results hold for in and out degrees and strengths, 

Classification criteria exposed in Section~\ref{sectioning} was used efficiently with windows of at least 200 messages. Specially with 1000 or more messages, criteria yields stable fractions of $\approx 5\%$ of hubs, $\approx [15-20]\%$ of intermediary and $\approx [75-80]\%$ peripheral vertexes, which match literature expectations~\cite{secFree}. A compound criteria, also described in Section~\ref{sectioning}, can be used as a classification refinement. This is specially useful in dealing with fewer messages, in which case the structure degenerates with respect to some of the degree and strength measures, but not all.
A minimum window size for observation of more general properties can be inferred by monitoring the giant component and the degeneration of hub, intermediary and peripheral sections. This degeneration is critical in the span of 50-100 messages for window sizes. With compound criteria, such as exclusive cascade of Figure~\ref{fig:cpp250_}, the networks seem to hold basic structure even with as few as 20-50 messages. This indicates that concentration of activity and low-activity participants occurs even with very few messages.

For the histograms used in the classification process, the usage of at least $\eta$ vertexes for each bin did not yield significant differences.
That was understood as a consequence of the observation scale:
\emph{There are between 20 and 1200 participants in the message window sizes used to derive most results ($ws \in [200,1500]$ messages). As peripheral vertexes are abundant and span few degrees, there are more than $\eta$ vertexes with each low degree value. Higher degrees cases requires a bit more reasoning. Specified $ws$ implicates that each participant is $p \in [0.1\%,0.5\%]$ of all participants. Therefore, if incident connectivity is very improbable in an Ed\"os R\`enyi network (less than $p$, the probability that a single participant represent when histogram is normalized to density function), than it is not an intermediary connectivity, but a hub.} This concludes the explanation of why using at least $\eta$ vertexes for each bin did not impact results.

Appendix~\ref{figures} is dedicated to figures of these networks and their evolution.

    \subsection{Prevalence of centrality over asymmetries and asymmetries over clusterization}\label{prevalence}

The principal component (PCA~\cite{pca}) exhibit ponderation of centrality measures: degrees, strengths and betweenness centrality. Clustering coefficient is presented in almost perfect orthogonality. Dispersion is more prevalent in symmetry related measures than clustering coefficient. This holds for all network snapshots observed, even with as few messages as to degenerate structure. Symmetric and asymmetric edges have been reported as bonded to different roles played by participants and relations~\cite{newmanEvolving}. Principal components formation from original measures can be observed in Tables~\ref{compPCA0},~\ref{compPCA} and~\ref{compPCA2}. Individual vertexes relation with top two principal components can be appreciated in Figures~\ref{PCA} and~\ref{PCA2}.
This peculiar first component that consists of the averaged sum of degree, strength and betweenness measures was verified to be incident in virtually all networks with 500 or more messages and most smaller networks (degeneration of basic structure is critical with $ws \approx 50-100$ messages). This composition of principal component suggests that all six degree and strength measures are equally important for system characterization, although it is known that they do not relate to the same participation characteristics.

As expected, degree and strength are highly correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficient $\in [0.95,1]$ and Pearson coefficient $\in [0.85,1)$ for larger window sizes ($ws>1000$). Also trivial: high degree is associated with low clustering coefficient, as can be observed in Figure~\ref{clust}.


When symmetry of node connectivity is considered, the first component remains mostly the same, but clustering coefficient is only relevant to third and fourth components. A snapshot of vertexes with respect to these first two principal components are in Figure~\ref{PCA2}. This asymmetry and disequilibrium measures revealed as more proper measures to characterization of hubs and intermediaries, as seen in greater spreading of second PCA plot. Both symmetry of node overall activity and of individual relations play important role in second component, as can be observed in Table~\ref{compPCA2}.

Table~\ref{compPCA} has the composition of principle components from the original measures. First principle component is a pondered sum of centrality measures: degrees, strengths and betweenness centrality. Second component is mostly clustering coefficient in this figure, but asymmetries holds second component if also considered. Similarity to plot in Figure~\ref{clust} was verified with all window sizes considered ($ws\;\in\;[100,10000]$), which exposes a common relation is held by degree, strength and betweenness measures to clustering coefficient.}

    \subsection{Primitive typology}

This work aimed at finding common characteristics among (email) interaction networks. Analysis involved primary measures observance and formal criteria for coherent ratios of hub, intermediary and hub sectors. Nevertheless, inspection done by visualizations and raw data manipulations suggests agents peculiarities of typological character. These are initial observations, which should be further developed as posed in Section~\ref{constDisc}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Core hubs usually have intermittent activity. Very stable activity was found on MET hubs, which motivated its integration to this work. Literature reports greater stability of participation in smaller communities~\cite{barabasiEvo}, reason why smaller number of participants in MET was considered coherent with the stable activity of hubs.
    \item Typically, hub activity is trivial: they interact as much as possible, in every occasion with everyone. Peripheral vertex activity also follows a simple pattern: they interact very rarely, in very few occasions. Intermediary vertexes seem responsible for network structure.
    \item Network operation exhibit modes that seem dictated by intermediary vertexes behavior. For example, these can exhibit preferential communication to peripheral, intermediary, or hub vertexes; can be marked by stable communication partners; can involve stable or intermittent patterns of activity.
    \item Some of the most active participants receive many responses with relative few messages sent, and rarely are top hubs. These seem as authorities and contrast with participants that respond way more than receive responses.
    \item Most obvious community structure, as observed by high clustering coefficient, is found only in peripheral and intermediary sectors.
\end{itemize}

This ``primitive typology'', characterized by peripheral, intermediary and hub types, can be further scrutinized using concepts involved in other typologies, such Meyer-Briggs, Pavlov or F-Scale. This has no pretension of being a direct result from numeric analysis, it is a description refinement of the found structure, in typological terms. Although initial, this bridges human and exact sciences in the most pertinent way authors were able to, as is herein considered a result.

\section{Conclusions and future work}
Characterization of interaction networks resulted from stability observations. Along temporal activity statistics, this work reports the stability of the principal components (in the concentration of dispersion and composition) and of the ternary partitioning (periphery, intermediary, hubs) relative sizes, evident in the comparison with the Erd\"os-R\'enyi model.


    \subsection{Further work}
The task of delivering a first and general characterization of chosen interaction networks involved starting a larger effort. The different aspects covered requires not only different analytical background, but also considerations about textual production and social psychology. These are receiving attention within dedicated works and are summarized in this section.

        \subsubsection{Constancy of general characteristics eases tipologization}

Regarding topological aspects of interaction networks, further work should inspect other measures (e.g. closeness centrality, accessibility), and statistics in each of the three connective sectors: hubs, intermediary and peripheral.

 Observance of attributes with greater contribution to principal components of LDA should reveal best chances to present these three sections as clusters in the network measurements space. Another possibility, specially for a brute-force characterization of such sections, is to remove vertexes with degree close to $k_1$ or $k_2$ depicted in figure~\ref{fig:setores}. The subtraction $\widetilde{P}(k)-P(k)$ should result in two positive clusters for periphery and hubs, and a negative cluster for intermediary vertexes. This might support classification of the three sectors by clustering, a more traditional approach to classification.

Observed networks were coherent with literature in different aspects, such as concentration of activity, and clusterization versus connectivity patterns. Even so, analysis of data from other virtual environments, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, should verify the generality of this report. 

A related work observed textual production of network sectors~\cite{rcText}. Resulting knowledge purposes networks and participants tipologization, and both topological and textual analysis should foster characterization of interaction networks and participation incidences in a dedicated study.
Stability reported in this article eases tipologization of outliers and more usual participation patterns.

        \subsubsection{Results exploitation}
Usage of such characteristics are taking place in linked data and electronic government technologies~\cite{ops,opa,ensaio}. Further steps involve elaboration and tests of social dynamics that takes advantages of these results.

\section{Deduction of edge existence probability in a directed network without self-loops}\label{ap:ded}
Be $\mathcal{N}$ a directed network without self-loops with $z$ edges and $N$ vertexes. The probability that an edge exists between two arbitrary vertex is $p_e=\frac{z}{max( \text{number of edges} |\ \text{N vertexes})}$, where $max( \text{number of edges} |\ \text{N vertexes})=2[(N-1)+(N-2)...1]=2[\sum_1^{N-1}i]=2[\frac{N(N-1)}{2}]$ is the maximum number of edges for a network with $N$ vertexes. Therefore:
\begin{align}
    p_e&=\frac{z}{max( \text{number of edges} |\ \text{N vertexes})}=\nonumber\\
       &=\frac{z}{2[(N-1)+(N-2)+...+1]}=\frac{z}{2\frac{N(N-1)}{2}}=\nonumber\\
   p_e &=\frac{z}{N(N-1)}
\end{align}


\section{Further consideration of related work}\label{sec:fure}
Unreciprocated edges often exceed 50\%, which matches empirical evidence reported in~\cite{newmanEvolving}. Although no correlation of topological characteristics and geographical position was found in a pertinent study~\cite{barabasiGeo}, geographical incidences should be present in further refinement of the analysis.

The seminal Nature Letter by Palla, Barab{\'a}si and Vicsek~\cite{barabasiEvo} has strong confluence with this work, suggesting that smaller size of MET community is responsible for the stronger hubs observed.

Controllability of these networks is also an uncovered issue. These has unintuitive properties and might bring into forefront crucial differences between email interaction networks and interaction networks in Facebook or Twitter~\cite{barabasiControlCapacity,barabasiControlCentrality,barabasiControllability}.

Gender related behavior in mobile phone datasets has been reported~\cite{barabasiSex}. This can be further investigated to hold in email lists and in evolving terms as community oriented, non-private interactions takes are drawn from public email groups with hundreds or thousands of participants. 

Considered years altogether, tenths of thousands of participants can post on a list. The most active lists usually reaches a few thousands of participants. Analysis of resulting data might lead to deeper insights in community-related network evolution~\cite{GMANE}.

\section{Data and scripts}\label{scripts}
Messages are downloaded from GMANE database by RSS in the mbox email text format. 
They are requested one by one to avoid reaching maximum size of the requests accepted by
GMANE API. 

Every message has about 30 fields, from which the following are crucial
for the present work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``From'' field, as it specifies the sender of the message, in the usual format of ``First\_name Last\_Name $<email>$''.
    \item ``Date'' field, which is given with the resolution of a second.
    \item ``Message-ID'', important to state antecedent/consequent relation between messages and therefore from an author to a replier.
    \item ``References'', has the ID of the message it is an answer to, if any, and earlier messages in the thread.
\end{itemize}

Field ``In-Reply-To'' has only the ID of the message it replies and can be sometimes
a shortcut or an alternative to ``References''. Also, the textual content of the messages,
accessed through ``payload'' method of the mbox message object, is of central interest and
the authors dedicated an article to include the textual content of the messages to the analysis~\cite{rcText}.

\subsection{Third party libraries and software}
The programming framework used 
is mainly Python-based, with emphasis on usual
scientific tools. More specifically,
scripts where written for 2.7.3 version of Python,
with the following third party libraries: Numpy, Pylab/Matplotlib, NetworkX, IGraph.
Behind the scenes, Graphviz is accessed via PyGraphviz to make network drawings.

\subsection{Python scripts}\label{ap:os}
All results were obtained with scripts written in the Python programming language. These are kept in a public git repository for backup and sharing with research community~\cite{scriptsFim}. Core scripts, for deriving structures and results exhibited in this article, are in the LEIAME file.

Two lists are exhibited in this section, CPP and LAD. These structures are very similar in all
four lists and laying extensively all figures is redundant. Window sizes of $ws =$ 10000, 5000,
1000, 500, 250, 100 and 50 messages were used.
