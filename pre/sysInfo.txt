The supporting information (this document) contains
statistics for time activity (circular statistics and his-
tograms) in Section I, the fraction of vertices in the pe-
ripheral, intermediary and hub sectors in Section III and
the combination of basic topological measures into princi-
pal components with greater variance in Section II. There
is a focus on email list interaction networks for bench-
marking and Section IV reinforces the results with the
analysis of networks from Facebook, Twitter and Partic-
ipa.br. More context (e.g. methods, discussion, data and
scripts) is given in the main document of the manuscript.

Provide any special instructions a reader would need to access the files.
Directions are given in the bibliography for online videos of evolving networks represented as animation and music.
The data is open and mostly officially available as part of the GMANE project.
the scripts for performing the analysis and that render images and videos are shared open Python PyPI packages.
