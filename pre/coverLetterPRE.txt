Please find attached the manuscript entitled "Temporal stability in human interaction networks", which we submit for publication in Physical Review E. The reasons why we chose PRE as the vehicle for our manuscript are as follows.
In the manuscript we report on the temporal stability of social networks with benchmarks deriving from email lists. We were unable to find similar results in the literature, though the findings are consistent with predictions and qualitative characterization of such social structures. This stability was proven beyond doubt using three methods of analysis, namely: activity along different timescales; prominence of topological metrics; and fraction of participants in each connective sector (hubs, intermediary and peripheral). In addition to demonstrating the temporal stability and benchmarking, these results enable sound observation of both network and participant outliers and consideration of the textual production of the networks, sectors and participants. Therefore, the document also presents a first approach to typologies in such context, which bridges exact and human sciences. Indeed, the authors of the manuscript belong to different fields, and the principles adopted in the research comply with open science principles, as the email data are officially part of the GMANE database, scripts are official PyPI packages, data from other social networks and further scripts are in the public Git repository. Furthermore, all the details of the theoretical developments and the results generated are given in a supplementary Supporting Information file, which will serve as guidance for anyone interested in the field. Because the methods applied belong to the realms of statistical physics (mainly) and are absolutely generic, we take the view that the manuscript may be of interest to a very wide readership. We believe that Physical Review E is therefore the ideal vehicle for this type of scientific contribution.
